We started off by creating a git repository and writing the initial socket code to successfully use bind, and to get used to creating threads. Mark created the git repository and wrote these few initial lines of thread and socket code. From that point on Brett wrote the rest of the code of the project. We sat together at his laptop, talking through the logic as we went, with him physically typing the code.
