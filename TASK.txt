We started off by creating a git repository and writing the initial socket code to successfully use bind, and to get used to creating threads. Mark created the git repository and wrote these few initial lines of thread and socket code. From that point on Brett wrote the rest of the code of the project but we were working together in figuring out the code to write, the logic to use, and worked through the debugging together.
